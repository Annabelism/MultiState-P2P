# MultiState-P2P
CS 242 Fall 2023 Final Project

HOW TO USE:
We need to first initialize an ORIGIN peer manually, that is, the first and ever
member of this network. 

We do so by initializing a node in the network, but this node will not have any
connections established since it is the first ever node in the network.

Then, we will test the basic functionality:
1. Joining the network as a new member
2. requesting a file from the ORIGIN
3. sharing file with the ORIGIN (receiving download request from ORIGIN)
4. Leaving the network

We will test this by having peer A join the network, and then having another peer
B join after peer A has joined. Then, we will make ORIGIN leave the network.
